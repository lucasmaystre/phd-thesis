The problem of recovering a ranking over $N$ items from noisy outcomes of pairwise comparisons has attracted, in the last century, much research interest, driven by applications in sports \citep{elo1978rating}, social sciences \citep{thurstone1927law, salganik2015wiki} and---more recently---recommender systems \citep{houlsby2012collaborative}.
Whereas pairwise comparison models and related inference algorithms have been extensively studied, the issue of \emph{which pairwise comparisons to sample}, also known as active learning, has received significantly less attention.
To understand the potential benefits of adaptively selecting samples, consider the case where comparison outcomes are noiseless, i.e., consistent with a linear order on a set of $N$ items.
If pairs of items are selected at random, it is necessary to collect \BigOmega{N^2} comparisons to recover the ranking \citep{alon1994linear}.
In contrast, by using an efficient sorting algorithm, \BigO{N \log N} adaptively chosen comparisons are sufficient.
In this work, we demonstrate that sorting algorithms can also be helpful in the \emph{noisy} setting, where some comparison outcomes are inconsistent with the ranking: despite errors, sorting algorithms tend to select informative samples.
We focus on the Bradley--Terry (BT) model, a widely-used probabilistic model of comparison outcomes.
In this model, each item is associated with a parameter on the real line, and the probability of observing an incorrect outcome decreases as the distance between the items' parameters increases.

First, we study the output of a single execution of Quicksort when comparison outcomes are generated from a BT model, under the assumption that the distance between adjacent parameters is (stochastically) uniform across the ranking.
We measure the quality of a ranking estimate by its displacement with respect to the ground truth, i.e., the sum of rank differences.
We show that Quicksort's output is a good approximation to the ground-truth ranking: no method comparing every pair of items at most once can do better (up to constant factors).
Furthermore, we show that by aggregating \BigO{\log^5 N} independent runs of Quicksort, it is possible to recover the exact rank for all but a vanishing fraction of the items.
These theoretical results suggest that adaptive sampling is able to bring a substantial acceleration to the learning process.

Second, we propose a practical active-learning (AL) strategy that consists of repeatedly sorting the items.
We evaluate our sorting-based method on three datasets and compare it to existing AL methods.
We observe that \emph{all} the strategies that we consider lead to better ranking estimates noticeably faster than random sampling.
However, most strategies are challenging to operate and computationally expensive, thus hindering wider adoption \citep{schein2007active}.
In this regard, sorting-based AL stands out, as
\begin{enuminline}
\item it is computationally-speaking as inexpensive as random sampling, 
\item it is trivial to implement, and
\item it requires no tuning of hyperparameters.
\end{enuminline}

\subsection{Preliminaries and Notation}

We consider $N$ items that are represented by consecutive integers $[N] = \{1, \ldots, N\}$.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the items are ranked by increasing preference\footnote{
This convention greatly simplifies the notation throughout the paper, but differs from that used in most of the preference learning literature.
In our paper, the item with rank $1$ is the \emph{worst}.}, i.e., $i < j$ means that $j$ is (in expectation) preferred to $i$.
When $j$ is preferred to $i$ as a result of a pairwise comparison, we denote the observation by $i \prec j$.
If $i < j$, we say that $i \prec j$ is a \emph{consistent} outcome and $j \prec i$ an \emph{inconsistent} (incorrect) outcome.
In most of the paper, pairwise comparison outcomes follow a Bradley--Terry model with parameters $\bm{\theta} = [\theta_1 \; \cdots \; \theta_N ]^\Tr \in \mathbf{R}^N$, denoted $\BT(\bm{\theta})$.
The parameters $\theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_N$ represent the utilities of items $1, \ldots, N$, and the probability of observing the outcome $i \prec j$ is
\begin{align*}
\Prob{i \prec j \mid \bm{\theta}} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp[-(\theta_j - \theta_i)]}.
\end{align*}
The probability of observing an inconsistent comparison decreases with the distance between the items.
This captures the intuitive notion that some pairs of items are easy to compare and some are more difficult \citep{zermelo1928berechnung, bradley1952rank}.

A ranking $\sigma$ is a function that maps an item to its rank, i.e., $\sigma(i) =$ rank of item $i$.
The (ground-truth) identity ranking is denoted by \Id, i.e. $\Id(i) = i$.
To measure the quality of a ranking $\sigma$ with respect to the ground-truth, we consider the \emph{displacement}
\begin{align*}
\Disp{\sigma} = \sum_{i=1}^N | \sigma(i) - i |,
\end{align*}
also known as Spearman's footrule distance.
Another metric widely used in practice is the Kendall--Tau distance, defined as
$K(\sigma) = \sum_{i < j} \Indic{\sigma(i) > \sigma(j)}$.
Both metrics are equivalent up to a factor of two\footnote{$\Disp{\sigma} / 2 \le K(\sigma) \le \Disp{\sigma}$ \citep{diaconis1977spearman}.}, such that bounds on \Disp{\sigma} also hold for $K(\sigma)$ up to constant factors.

Finally, we say that an event $A$ holds \emph{with high probability} if $\Prob{A} \to 1$ as $N \to \infty$.
For a random variable $X$ and a sequence of numbers $a_N$, we say that $X = \BigO{a_N}$ with high probability if $\Prob{\Abs{X} \le c a_N} \to 1$ as $N \to \infty$ for some constant $c$ that does not depend on $N$.
