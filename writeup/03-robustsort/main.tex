\chapter{Active Learning}
\label{ch:robustsort}

In this chapter\footnote{%
This chapter is based on \citet{maystre2017just}.},
we develop a data-efficient method for learning a ranking by using adaptively chosen pairwise comparisons (a setting known as \emph{active learning}).
Our goal is to recover the ranking accurately but to sample the comparisons sparingly.
If all comparison outcomes are consistent with the ranking, the optimal solution is to use an efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quicksort.
But how do sorting algorithms behave if some comparison outcomes are inconsistent with the ranking?
We give favorable guarantees for Quicksort for the Bradley--Terry model, under natural assumptions on the parameters.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that sorting algorithms lead to a very simple and effective active learning strategy: repeatedly sort the items.
This strategy performs as well as state-of-the-art methods (and much better than random sampling) at a minuscule fraction of the computational cost.
