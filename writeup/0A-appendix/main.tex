\chapter{Python Library}

In this appendix\footnote{%
This appendix is based in part on the documentation of the \texttt{choix} library, available online at \url{http://choix.lum.li/en/latest/}.},
we give a brief overview of \texttt{choix}, an open-source Python library that provides inference algorithms for models based on Luce's choice axiom.
The library was used for most experiments presented in this thesis and its code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/lucasmaystre/choix}.
