\section{Outline and Contributions}
\label{in:sec:outline}

This thesis revisits Luce's choice model with an eye towards online services.
It tackles the problem of \emph{efficiently} finding a ranking over a set of items (usually, by means of estimating model parameters).
Efficiency is the guiding thread:
\begin{itemize}
\item as the size of datasets grows large, it becomes important to develop inference methods that are \emph{computationally} efficient, without sacrificing their \emph{statistical} efficiency, i.e., their accuracy, and
\item as the number of distinct items grows large, it becomes important to sample observations intelligently, such that the observations bring as much information as possible; we will refer to this by \emph{data} efficiency.
\end{itemize}
