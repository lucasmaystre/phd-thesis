In this paper, we present a method that tackles the problem of finding the transition probabilities along the edges of a network, given only the network's structure and aggregate node-level traffic data.
This method generalizes and extends ideas recently presented by \citet{kumar2015inverting}.
We demonstrate that in spite of the strong model assumptions needed to learn $O(n^2)$ probabilities from $O(n)$ observations, the method still manages to recover the transition probabilities to a good level of accuracy on two clickstream datasets, and shows promise for applications beyond clickstream data.
To sum up, we believe that our method will be useful to pracitioners interested in understanding patterns of navigation in networks from aggregate traffic data, commonly available, e.g., in public datasets.
