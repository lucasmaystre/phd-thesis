\chapter{Predicting Football Matches}
\label{ch:playerkern}

In this chapter\footnote{%
This chapter is based on \citet*{maystre2016player}.},
we shift our attention from human choices to sports outcomes.
In particular, we draw attention to a connection between skill-based models of game outcomes (built on the Bradley--Terry model) and Gaussian-process classification models.
The Gaussian-process perspective enables
\begin{enuminline}
\item a principled way of dealing with uncertainty and
\item rich models, specified through kernel functions.
\end{enuminline}
Using this connection, we tackle the problem of predicting outcomes of football matches between national teams.
We develop a \emph{player kernel} that relates any two football matches through the players lined up on the field.
This makes it possible to share knowledge gained from observing matches between clubs (available in large quantities) and matches between national teams (available only in limited quantities).
We evaluate our approach on the Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016 final tournaments.
