Statistical models of game outcomes have a rich and diverse history, going back almost a century:
as early as 1928, \citep{zermelo1928berechnung} proposed a simple algorithm that infers the skill of chess players based on observed game outcomes.
Zermelo's ideas have since been rediscovered and refined multiple times, and have been successfully applied to various sports-related prediction problems and beyond.
On the occasion of the Euro 2016 football tournament, we revisit these ideas and highlight their connections to modern machine learning techniques.
In particular, we show how Zermelo's model can be cast as a Gaussian process classification model.
The Gaussian process framework provides two key advantages.
First, it brings all the benefits of Bayesian inference. In particular it provides a principled way to deal with the uncertainty associated to noisy observations and to predictions.
Second, it opens up new modeling perspectives through the specification of kernel functions.

Equipped with this, we investigate the problem of predicting outcomes of football matches between national teams.
We identify two key challenges,
\begin{enuminline}
\item that of \emph{data sparsity} (national teams usually play no more than ten matches per year), and
\item that of \emph{data staleness} (the team roster is constantly evolving).
\end{enuminline}
Taking inspiration from the observation that national teams' players frequently face each other in competitions between clubs (see Figure~\ref{pk:fig:sankey}), we show that these two difficulties can be tackled by the introduction of a \emph{player kernel}.
This kernel relates any two matches through the players lined up on the field, and makes it possible to seamlessly use matches between clubs to improve a predictive model ultimately used for matches between national teams.
In contrast to national teams, clubs play much more frequently, and more data is available.

\paragraph{Outline of the Chapter}
The remainder of this short chapter is organized as follows.
We review related work in Section~\ref{pk:sec:relwork}.
In Section~\ref{pk:sec:methods}, we formalize the link between Zermelo's ideas and Gaussian processes, and present our player kernel.
Then, in Section~\ref{pk:sec:evaluation}, we evaluate our predictive model on the Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016 final tournaments.
