\section{Summary}
\label{pk:sec:summary}

In this short chapter, we have exposed a connection between a well-known pairwise comparison model and Gaussian-process classification, and have proposed a kernel that is able to transfer knowledge across different types of football matches---those between clubs and those between national teams.
We have shown that a predictive model built on these ideas achieves a logarithmic loss that is competitive with betting odds.
In future work, we would like to investigate how to incorporate aging into the model, i.e., how to progressively downweight older data.
