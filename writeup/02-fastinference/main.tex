\chapter{Fast and Accurate Inference of Plackett--Luce Models}

We show that the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of models derived from Luce's choice axiom (e.g., the Plackett--Luce model) can be expressed as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain.
This conveys insight into several recently proposed spectral inference algorithms.
We take advantage of this perspective and formulate a new spectral algorithm that is significantly more accurate than previous ones for the Plackett--Luce model.
With a simple adaptation, this algorithm can be used iteratively, producing a sequence of estimates that converges to the ML estimate.
The ML version runs faster than competing approaches on a benchmark of five datasets.
Our algorithms are easy to implement, making them relevant for practitioners at large.
