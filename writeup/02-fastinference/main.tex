\chapter{Parameter Inference}
\label{ch:fastinference}

In this chapter\footnote{%
This chapter is based on \citet{maystre2015fast}.},
we study the problem of inferring parameters of models derived from Luce's choice axiom.
We begin by showing that the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) can be expressed as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain.
This conveys insight into several recently proposed spectral inference algorithms.
We then take advantage of this perspective and formulate a new spectral algorithm that generalizes and improves upon prior work.
With a simple adaptation, this algorithm can be used iteratively, producing a sequence of estimates that converges to the MLE.
The MLE version runs faster than competing approaches on a benchmark of five datasets.
